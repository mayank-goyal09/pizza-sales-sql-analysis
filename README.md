# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

## Overview

Every slice sold tells a story. Every order reveals a preference. Every hour of business captures a pattern. When you understand these stories, you transform raw transaction records into strategic intelligence that shapes menu decisions, staffing schedules, and revenue growth.

This project explores pizza sales data through the power of SQL queries. Rather than just counting sales, I focused on understanding the business beneath the numbers. What pizzas do customers truly want? When do they want them? Which combinations drive the highest revenue? These questions matter because they translate directly into profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Why SQL for This Analysis?

SQL is the foundation of data analysis for a reason. It allows you to ask precise questions of your data and get immediate, accurate answers. For a pizza business tracking thousands of transactions, SQL provides:

* **Direct access to transactional truth** – Query exact sales figures, order details, and customer behavior patterns without interpretation layers
* **Speed and efficiency** – Process large volumes of orders and calculate complex revenue metrics in seconds
* **Flexibility for exploration** – Pivot from analyzing top selling categories to understanding hourly demand patterns with simple query adjustments
* **Business focused insights** – Connect individual pizza orders to strategic questions about menu optimization and revenue maximization

## Business Questions Explored

This analysis addresses the strategic questions that drive pizza business decisions:

### Revenue Intelligence
* What is the total revenue generated across all orders?
* Which pizza categories (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken) contribute most to the bottom line?
* What is the average order value, and how does it vary by pizza size or type?
* Which specific pizzas are revenue champions versus volume sellers?

### Customer Preference Patterns  
* What are the most ordered pizza types, and why do customers choose them?
* How do size preferences (Small, Medium, Large, XL) distribute across orders?
* Which pizza combinations appear most frequently in customer orders?
* What does the distribution of orders tell us about customer behavior?

### Operational Insights
* When are peak ordering hours, and how should staffing adjust accordingly?
* How many pizzas are sold on average per order?
* What is the order distribution throughout the day, and when should inventory be highest?
* How do daily and hourly trends inform preparation and delivery strategies?

## Analytical Approach

Each query in this project serves a specific business purpose:

1. **Foundation queries** establish baseline metrics – total orders, revenue, average values
2. **Aggregation queries** reveal patterns in categories, sizes, and pizza types  
3. **Ranking queries** identify top performers and strategic priorities
4. **Time based queries** uncover demand patterns across hours and days
5. **Combination queries** answer complex questions by joining multiple data perspectives

## Key Insights Uncovered

Through structured SQL exploration, this analysis reveals:

* **Revenue drivers** – The specific pizzas and categories generating the highest returns
* **Customer preferences** – What customers actually order, not what we assume they want  
* **Operational timing** – When demand peaks and how to prepare for it
* **Menu optimization opportunities** – Which offerings deserve prominent placement and which may need reevaluation
* **Strategic pricing insights** – How size and type affect both volume and revenue

## The Strategic Value

For a pizza business owner, these insights translate into concrete actions:

* **Optimize inventory** based on actual demand patterns rather than guesswork
* **Adjust staffing schedules** to match peak hours identified through data
* **Refine menu placement** by promoting proven revenue generators
* **Inform pricing strategy** using revenue per unit and order value analysis  
* **Improve customer satisfaction** by ensuring popular items are always available

For an analyst or data professional, this project demonstrates:

* **SQL proficiency** across aggregations, joins, rankings, and time series analysis
* **Business thinking** – translating queries into strategic recommendations
* **Structured problem solving** – breaking complex business questions into answerable queries  
* **Practical application** – using data tools to drive real business outcomes

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

* Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) for calculating business metrics
* GROUP BY operations for categorical analysis and segmentation
* ORDER BY and LIMIT for ranking and prioritization  
* Date and time functions for temporal pattern analysis
* JOIN operations for combining related data sources
* Subqueries for complex comparative analysis
* Data filtering with WHERE clauses for focused insights
